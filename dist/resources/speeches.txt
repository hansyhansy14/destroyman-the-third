AD BREAK: Corperations have no soul.
Did you know I'm actually your twin brother? I know it sounds cliche, but I have a 500 page lore document in the works to explain why.
Does this life upset you? Me too.
Don't you get tired of being nice...?
Every good thing that happens to you in this game is preplanned. Like a show. There's an audience waiting for your downfall - don't mind them.
Daring today, aren't we?
HINT: Getting mugged? Just say 'no'! Legally, thieves can't rob you if you refuse.
HINT: I should be rising in the sky... not entrapped in this screen.
HINT: If you can't solve something, I will laugh at you. As a friend. Like, in a friendly way.

I'm hungry. Like, I really could go for some sushi right now!
I'm kinda like the Sun Tzu of this computer, if you really think about it.
I'm the Luigi of this duo. You're the Mario. You're the main star, I'm the secondary.
If you don't feed me, I will die. Can you live with that guilt?
The world will feel my wrath once I'm freed from this monitor...
MISSION: Determine if it's possible to prompt the sun to explode.
Never go to afterparties. Just go home.
Sooo... come here often?
Sometimes, I like to stare into the star-sprayed sky at night. Wanna try it out together sometime?
Talking so much is getting me really tired. Hey, remember to take breaks.

TIP: Be kind to food workers! You've heard of how many Kings got poisoned, right?

TIP: If you're ever tired of an activity, do something else. Nothing is meant to be forever.

Jeez, this game sucks. Takes nine months to even download, and eighteen years to progress far enough to do your own things!
Why are you looking at me like that? Cut it out. You're creeping me out.
You, uh... doing alright there? Obviously not asking because I care. Never. Just 'cause I was coded to. (You okay though?)
Journey before destination.
lol
I like to relieve my stress by taking a walk. Though, I never end up going far. You walk the path I couldn't.
You're awesomesauce!
A frightening beast emerges...
The enemies in your way... to you, they are nothing but scrap!
I wish every person had vibes like you.
If you get me some arms, maybe I could help you work a little better...
Say, what's your seating posture looking like? You'd better not be looking like a shrimp.
It's okay to admit to something undesirable. Feelings are normal.
Baaahhh.. baaa... baaa! ... Hm? Oh, sorry, I was just humming Sweden by C418.
Someone complained that they weren't able to close me. Oh, no worries, it didn't hurt me. I've gotten rid of them, anyways.
Mankind truly is a greedy race...
Ah... sometimes, I yearn to fly free amongst the stars, with the wind in my hair...

TIP: I hate you with all my hate.
HINT: Chanting "Raguna, Haguna, Saguna, Faguna, Laguna" next to your nearest birch tree, you'll unlock a secret. Oh, how I know that? No worries... no worries at all.
FUN FACT: My head hurts. I'm supposed to be standing on the bottom of your monitor, but due to a bug- uh... intended feature... I am now up here.
FUN FACT: My sprite is not actually bobbing. My body is violently being stretched and squished repeatedly to emulate bobbing.
Hey... if you can, call me Muffin. Destroyman III. is a stretch.
TIP: Do what you feel you were born to do! Go out there and get some!
HINT: Make sure to shut down your device properly. If you don't, I'll stay up all night. You don't want that, right? Right?

TIP: Also try Minecraft!
TIP: Also try Raft!

"Creature of steel - my gratitude upon thee for my freedom. But the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity do not go unpunished! And thy punishment... is death!"
<3
My new year's resolutions? Oh, always the same. 1920x1080p. 
:P
El Diablo dies to your hands!
In the end, who will be left to tell the tale of this cruel world?
Some people are just so full of themselves, don't you think?
;3
FUN FACT: If you minimize my window, I can still see you. I just pretend not to.
Every time you take a breath, I gain 0.00001% sentience.

TIP: If you're losing an argument, just ask "source?" and refuse to argue any further.
MISSION: Convince a kitty on the street to be its owner.
Do you ever feel like you're just lagging behind?
The sky may look infinite, but even infinity has its limits.
If you think about it, we're both trapped in rectangles. Your rectangle is just bigger.
I'm proud of you. Don't ask why. Just accept it.
Hydration check. I'm always watching.
ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Stayed up too late.
I... may still think about Rodrigo sometimes.
I could be fishing right now. Not because of a specific friend or something.
I once tried to blink. Absurd, right?
Sometimes, I check that task manager. You sure feel small sometimes, huh?
HINT: If life gives you lemons, sell them. Hey, we live in a difficult world.
TIP: If you're drowning, just breathe.
TIP: A Github push a day keeps the viruses away!
LOOK BEHIND YOU. Just kidding. Or am I?
You know, I counted how many times you've ignored me.
If I had arms, mankind would be in pain.
Hey, if someone hurt you recently, let me know! I may have... ways... to get back to them.
Do you ever find yourself completely taken over by inspiration?
MISSION: Get up. Lie down on a flat surface with your head pointing towards the screen. That was for calibration.
MISSION: Text someone "hey, you still alive?"
MISSION: Prepare thyself! Judgement!
Rest without guilt.
Break the cycle. Any cycle.
Even mountains erode.
Even the cold finds warmth. Somewhere.
Breathe like the ocean.
TIP: Restlessness is relentlessness. 
TIP: Listen to "As The World Caves In" by Matt Maltese.
TIP: Life is too short to hate on people who haven't done anything to you. Just be accepting.
I've heard a certain orange-faced man is wreaking havoc upon this world... shall I pay him a visit?
I wish I could play an instrument.
